This is a web app idea that I had a few years ago but never released.  It is a
goal/habits tracking site that would help people stay motivated by providing
a clear progress dashboard and social integration to get encouragement from
friends.  It was written for Google App Engine using Python, Flask, and Jinja2.

I'm releasing this under the MIT license in case someone out there can find
some use from the code.
